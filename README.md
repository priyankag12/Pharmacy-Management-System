# Pharmacy-Management-System
The Online Pharmacy Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the operations of a pharmacy by providing an online platform for both pharmacists and customers. The system facilitates easy management of inventory, prescription processing, patient management, billing, and reporting, enhancing efficiency and improving patient care. Built using Java programming language with NetBeans IDE, and utilizing SQL for database management, the system offers a user-friendly interface and robust functionality to meet the needs of modern pharmacies.

## Inventory Management: 
The system maintains a comprehensive database of medications, including details such as name, quantity, expiration dates, batch numbers, and suppliers. It tracks stock levels in real-time, automatically generating alerts when supplies are low or when medications are nearing their expiration dates.

## Security and Data Protection: 
Pharmacy management systems employ robust security measures to protect sensitive patient information and comply with data protection laws. This includes encryption, user authentication, audit trails, and regular data backups.
