# Pharmacy-Management-System
A pharmacy management system is a software solution designed to streamline and automate various aspects of pharmacy operations, including inventory management, prescription processing, patient management, billing, and reporting.

## Inventory Management: 
The system maintains a comprehensive database of medications, including details such as name, quantity, expiration dates, batch numbers, and suppliers. It tracks stock levels in real-time, automatically generating alerts when supplies are low or when medications are nearing their expiration dates.

## Security and Data Protection: 
Pharmacy management systems employ robust security measures to protect sensitive patient information and comply with data protection laws. This includes encryption, user authentication, audit trails, and regular data backups.
